# DASHBOARD-OF-MEDICAL
This dashboard uses categorical data to compare ,  types and outcomes;  to measure beds, cost and doctor workload; time-based data to identify trends and peak periods; and percentage metrics to show utilization efficiency. It helps administrators quickly identify bottlenecks, resource pressure, and performance gaps for better hospital planning.

# insights
STEP 1: Patient Admission Insight
The dashboard first shows total patient admissions split by Emergency and Scheduled cases.
 Insight: Emergency cases are higher, indicating pressure on emergency services and need for readiness.
STEP 2: Department-Wise Load
Admissions and bed usage are compared across departments like Cardiology, Emergency, Orthopedics, etc.
 Insight: Some departments handle more patients, showing uneven workload distribution.
STEP 3: Bed Occupancy Insight
Bed occupancy data shows how many beds are occupied versus available.
 Insight: High occupancy indicates possible bed shortages and delayed admissions or discharges.
STEP 4: Doctor Utilization Insight
Doctor available hours are compared with booked hours.
 Insight: Certain departments show high doctor utilization, signaling staff overload and burnout risk.
STEP 5: Cost Analysis Insight
Treatment cost per admission is visualized.
 Insight: Some admissions are cost-intensive, helping management control expenses and improve budgeting.
STEP 6: Patient Outcome Insight
Patient outcomes such as Recovered, Improved, or Transferred are displayed.
 Insight: Majority positive outcomes reflect good care quality, while transfers highlight critical cases.
STEP 7: Branch-Wise Comparison
Patient load is compared across hospital branches.
 Insight: Some branches manage higher patient volume, requiring better resource allocation.
STEP 8: Overall Operational Insight
By combining all visuals, the dashboard identifies bottlenecks, peak workloads, staffing pressure, and capacity gaps.
 Final Insight: The hospital can improve efficiency through better staffing, bed planning, and cost control.
